## 1. What is Open Source?

Open-source software (OSS) is software whose **source code is publicly available**.  
Anyone can **view, use, modify, and share** the code.

In simple terms, the code is not locked or secret. This openness allows people to learn from it, improve it, and adapt it to their needs.

## 2. Key Features of Open Source

Open-source software differs from proprietary software in the following ways:

| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| Source Code Access | Code is publicly available |
| Free to Use | Usually free of cost |
| Modifiable | Can be changed as per requirements |
| Redistributable | Can be legally shared |
| Community-Driven | Built and improved by contributors worldwide |

## 3. Open Source Platforms

Open-source projects are hosted and developed on collaborative platforms such as:

1. **GitHub** (most popular and beginner-friendly)
2. GitLab
3. Bitbucket
4. SourceForge
5. Launchpad

**GitHub** is the best starting point for beginners to explore projects, read code, and contribute.

## 4. How Open Source Works: Contribution Cycle

Open source follows a collaborative workflow:

1. **Project Creation**  
   A developer creates a project, uploads it to a platform (e.g., GitHub), and adds a license.

2. **Public Access**  
   Anyone can view, download, and study the code.

3. **Finding Issues or Improvements**  
   Users may discover bugs, suggest features, or improve documentation.

4. **Suggesting Changes**
   - **Issue**: Report a bug or idea.
   - **Pull Request (PR)**: Fork the repo, make changes, and submit a PR.

5. **Maintainer Review**  
   The maintainer reviews the contribution and decides to accept, reject, or request changes.

6. **Project Improvement**  
   Accepted changes become part of the project, benefiting all users.

This cycle repeats continuously.

### Important Rule
**Open source is open to participate, not open to control.**  
Final decisions are always made by the maintainer to preserve quality and vision.

## 5. Open Source Programs and Opportunities

Open source contributions can lead to learning, networking, and even paid opportunities.

Popular programs include:

- Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
- LFX Mentorship
- Google Summer of Bitcoin
- Outreachy

These programs are competitive but provide valuable real-world experience and industry exposure.
