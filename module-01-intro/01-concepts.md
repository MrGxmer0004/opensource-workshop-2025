# Module 1: Introduction to Open Source

## 1. What is Open Source?

Open-source software (OSS) is software whose source code is openly available for anyone to view, use, modify, and share. In simple terms, instead of being locked or secret, the code is public. This allows people to study it, improve it, or adapt it for their own needs.

## 2. Key Features of Open Source

Open source software is characterized by several key features that distinguish it from proprietary software.

| Feature | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Source Code Access | The source code is publicly available for inspection and modification. |
| Free to Use | Usually free of cost, though not always. |
| Modifiability | Can be modified to suit user requirements. |
| Redistributability | Can be redistributed legally. |
| Community-Driven | Developed and improved by a community of developers. |

## 3. Open Source Platforms

To get the feel of open source, we need to explore platforms where open source software is hosted, shared, and developed. Here are some of the most popular platforms:

1. GitHub (most widely used)
2. GitLab
3. Bitbucket
4. SourceForge (older but still used)
5. Launchpad

GitHub is the easiest platform to explore projects, read code, and contribute, making it the best starting point for beginners.

## 4. How Open Source Works: The Cycle of Contribution

A common question is: what if the developer doesn't want any unnecessary changes, but since the code is open to all, anyone can modify it? The answer lies in the collaborative nature of open source.

1. A Developer Creates Software:  
   A developer writes code, uploads it to a platform like GitHub, marks it as public, and adds a license. This becomes an open-source project.

2. People Around the World Can See It:  
   Anyone can view the code, download it, run it, and study how it works.

3. Someone Finds an Issue or Improvement Idea:  
   A user may find a bug, think of a new feature, or want to improve the documentation.

4. Suggesting Changes:  
   There are two ways to suggest changes:
   - **Issue**: A person creates an issue, describes the problem or idea, and the maintainer decides what to do.
   - **Code Contribution**: A person forks the repository (makes a copy), makes changes in their own copy, and sends a Pull Request (PR).

5. Maintainer Reviews:  
   The maintainer reviews the changes, checks the code quality, tests the functionality, and sees if the change aligns with the project's goals. The decision is to either accept, reject, or ask for edits.

6. Software Improves:  
   Accepted changes become part of the project, and everyone now uses better software. This cycle repeats continuously.

### Important Rule: Open to Participate, Not Open to Control

Open source is open to participate, not open to control. The final decision rests with the maintainer, and there are no forced changes. This ensures that the project maintains its vision and quality.

## 5. Open Source Competitions and Programs

Contributing to open source is not just about learning and building your portfolio; it can also lead to exciting opportunities. Many organizations run programs to encourage and reward open source contributions. These programs are a fantastic way to gain real-world experience, work with established projects, and even earn a stipend.

Some of the most popular open source programs include:

- Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
- LFX Mentorship
- Google Summer of Bitcoin
- Outreachy

These programs are highly competitive, but they offer an incredible opportunity to immerse yourself in the open source community and make a significant impact.
