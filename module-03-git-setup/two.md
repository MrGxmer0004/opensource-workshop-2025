Before we begin installing Git, it will be better to create a GitHub account so that we don't have to toggle in between our installation and configuring process.

Link for signing up in GitHub --> [Sign Up](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)

Now let us continue with our installation.

## <img src="Images and vids\link.png" alt="Alt text" width="20 " height="20"> 1. Open the Git website:

Go to --> [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

We'll see something like this:

Download from the first link saying ``Click here to download`` and wait for the installation to complete.

* Select the Desktop shortcut int the first pop up to access GitBash easily.

* <img src="Images and vids\important.png" alt="Alt text" width="15" height="15"> **Make sure to select VS Code as the default editor** instead of Vim as the course will be conducted through VS Code.

* A video has been uploaded under Images and vids folder named ``installation_instructions.mp4`` to help you in need.

<video controls src="Images and vids\installation_instructions.mp4" title="Title"></video>

* Wait for the installation to complete and click on ``Finish`` .

Use Terminal (For Windows: <img src="Images and vids\windows11.png" alt="Alt text" width="10" height="10">+R then ``cmd.exe``) or GitBash to confirm installation by typing ``git --version``

It should display something like ``git version 2.52.0.windows.1``.
